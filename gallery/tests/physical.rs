//! What the chrome measures on the glass.
//!
//! Every other test in this suite counts pixels, and a pixel is not a size.
//! The same 40-pixel row is 4.6mm on an X4 and 3.9mm on an X3 because one
//! panel is denser than the other; the firmware's own board table says a 30px
//! row at these densities "is only ~3mm", which is where a finger stops
//! finding it.
//!
//! So these convert through each panel's ppi and assert millimetres. A change
//! that leaves the pixel numbers alone and moves the chrome onto a denser
//! panel still fails here, and so does one that drops a board's UI scale —
//! neither of which a pixel comparison can notice.

/// - **A list row, anywhere.** Above the ~3mm the firmware calls too small,

///   phone platform asks for. The touch boards reach it only because of their

/// - **A line of body text.** Above the 3mm a row is judged by, on every panel
///   here. The binding case is the X3: at 257 ppi it is the densest panel this
